## About Morth

I created this website because I was bored and couldn't find good resources to practice my beginner-level Morse code skills.

As a computer science student passionate about web development, I wanted to build something useful while improving my skills. This is my first complete website project.

I'm considering adding a learning section where you can interactively learn Morse code from scratch. But first, I want to make sure the training platform works well and is helpful.

This project started from boredom but became a passion project. I hope it helps others who want to train Morse code as much as it helped me train web development.
